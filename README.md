OVERVIEW OF WEBSITE:
The goal is to create a simple text based browser game in the style of "choose your own adventure".
The main webpage will consist of a main menu that contains a start button, info button, and about button that can be accessed from the main menu.The start button will change the page to the main game.
the help page will give a short description on how the game operates, and a short overview of the game.
Also there will be a leaderboard list all the how long it has taken other players to finish it.


The main game will have  5 parts:

Setting
Story
Player actions
Top Navbar

The setting a header that tells the basic of the scene.
The story box has a large block of text in the center of the screen describing the current scene the player is in, which can alter the text depending on what player action is chosen in the player actions block.
The player actions box is a small rectangular box in the bottom of the page having a few actions or responses the player can click on for that particular scene.The top navbar will have a return button (to return to main menu).

OVERVIEW OF DATA STORAGE:
The back end data will store the user name they create from a node and the time that it takes them to complete it.
